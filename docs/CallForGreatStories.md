I’m excited to start the publication Developer’s Coffee. The heart of our mission: to help readers get smarter at building their things; and to offer writers a platform to share their stories — of work, inspiration, and creativity.

We’ve decided to start our Developer’s Coffee publication. Here’s why.

To me, The Startup should be a digital visit to a space for education and inspiration. As editor, I want to curate original and valuable insights from our contributors. I want readers to walk away inspired — and equipped with the tools to realize their own [Pont Neuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Neuf).

But more recently, we’ve come up against some challenges.

The beauty of working with an innovative platform like Medium is that traditional publishing barriers are removed. Anyone (with a Medium account) can submit a story for consideration.

I want to reestablish our standards and in doing so, give authors better, clearer guidance to boost their chances of being published on Developer’s Coffee. And, I want to cultivate a diversity of voices.

And authors: Once you submit, we promise, we read and carefully consider every single story. With the Medium interface, we see your headline before we see your name. Our publication decisions are based on merit, not your existing portfolio. The benefit of this, and the excitement for us editors, is that we have the opportunity to offer a platform to new and emerging writers.

> And trust me: great writing shines instantly.

## So let’s start with our revamped editorial strategy.

To pull back the curtain on our editorial strategy, I think it’s necessary to consider four questions.
### 1. Who are we?

In short: The Developer’s Coffee isn’t just for tech entrepreneurs.

Our readers and contributors include founders, creatives, designers, developers, marketers, freelancers, and writers.

Some are 9–5 office professionals launching a side hustle; others have already founded a startup (or several); still, others are just at that nascent, daydreaming stage, taking the first step toward planning to build their thing.

Regardless of where they are on their entrepreneurial path, The Developer’s Coffee should be a resource — because it’s never been easier to start a company, but it’s also never been harder to build something successfully.

### 2. What do we cover?

Big picture, our content falls into two categories.

First, **the “evergreen” topics**. These include:

- **Maker life:** Entrepreneurship, creativity, freelancing, startups, investing, innovation, marketing, social media
- **Culture today:** leadership, diversity, inclusivity, climate change and sustainability.
- **Technology:** Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, VR/AR/MR, IoT, robotics, data science, machine learning and big data.
- **Web dev and design:** UX, UI, design, developing, programming, apps, software, hardware and SaaS.

### 3. How can I be published?

If you’re wondering how to increase your chances of becoming one of our writers, here, some tips for making your story shine when submitting to The Startup.

- **Do the research —** Not infrequently, we receive stories that include assertion after assertion with zero authoritative sources or research. Unless you’re Elon Musk, you’ll need something to hang your hat on. On second thought, we’d probably ask Musk for links to sources, too. Because even the best writers back their facts up with references — be it published research or expert opinion. Include links to sources that support the factual assertions in your writing.
- **Don’t skimp on the intro —** You know what they say: first impressions are everything. Get creative with your introduction. Drop us into the action; paint a vivid picture of a real-life example; come up with an attention-grabbing way to introduce us to your story, be it a shocking research finding or a little-known statistic.
- **Master the headline —** We can help you tweak this part, but the stories that immediately grab our attention already have strong headlines and subheads. Consider the stories that draw you in — do their headlines sound like clickbait-y advertisements? (The Secret to This Productivity Hack Will Shock You!) Or, are they thoughtful, high-quality propositions that leave you deeply curious for more. (Productivity Is About Prioritizing, Not About Time Management). I’m guessing the latter.
- **Don’t transplant ideas —** Again, we allow and even encourage you to rely on other publications to support your facts. But we do not accept the transplanting of another writer’s ideas entirely. (Also, it violates Medium’s rules against plagiarism.) Simply rewording doesn’t cut the mustard, either.
- **Read our publication —** Your birth story might be very interesting but that doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for our publication. Take some time to browse our publication before sending us your story.
- **Ask yourself: why?** Why should the reader spend the time it takes (typically 5–10 minutes) to read your story? Will it add value to their lives? Will it entertain them? Could it change their way of thinking? It’s good practice to consider the “why” before you sit down to write anything.

### 4. How will The Developer’s Coffee support me, the writer?

During the editing process, we’ll work with authors to make their stories even better. We’ll also regularly share guides and tips for getting published. Consider this the first of an ongoing series of stories from The Developer’s Coffee, aimed at improving our communication and providing you the tools to get your great stories heard.

As an official Medium partner, The Developer’s Coffee will work to achieve an even higher rate of curation for our authors and distribute their stories to an even wider audience.
